    <p>
        This recipe is for a traditional red posole, which is a stew that originates from Mexico.  This is one of my favorite
        dishes that is usually made during the colder weather season, but I enjoy it year round in my house
        since it is that good! Pork is traditionally used, but it can be substituted for chicken if prefered.
